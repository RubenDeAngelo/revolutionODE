	abstract = {There is a strong link between mental health and physical health, but little is known about the pathways from one to the other. We analyse the direct and indirect effects of past mental health on present physical health and past physical health on present mental health using lifestyle choices and social capital in a mediation framework. We use data on 10,693 individuals aged 50 years and over from six waves (2002–2012) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Mental health is measured by the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES) and physical health by the Activities of Daily Living (ADL). We find significant direct and indirect effects for both forms of health, with indirect effects explaining 10\% of the effect of past mental health on physical health and 8\% of the effect of past physical health on mental health. Physical activity is the largest contributor to the indirect effects. There are stronger indirect effects for males in mental health (9.9\%) and for older age groups in mental health (13.6\%) and in physical health (12.6\%). Health policies aiming at changing physical and mental health need to consider not only the direct cross-effects but also the indirect cross-effects between mental health and physical health.},

	abstract = {We present and discuss a variety of mathematical models that have been proposed to capture the dynamic behavior of epidemic processes. We first present traditional group models for which no underlying graph structures are assumed, thus implying that instantaneous mixing between all members of a population occurs. Then we consider models driven by similar principles, but involving non-trivial networks where spreading occurs between connected nodes. We present stability analysis results for selected models from both classes, as well as simple least squares approaches for estimating the spreading parameters of the virus from data for each basic networked model structure. We also provide some simulation models. The paper should serve as a succinct, accessible guide for systems and control research efforts toward understanding and combating COVID-19 and future pandemics.},

	abstract = {We give a survey of results on global stability for deterministic compartmental epidemiological models. Using Lyapunov techniques we revisit a classical result, and give a simple proof. By the same methods we also give a new result on differential susceptibility and infectivity models with mass action and an arbitrary number of compartments. These models encompass the so-called differential infectivity and staged progression models. In the two cases we prove that if the basic reproduction ratio R0 ≤ 1, then the disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. If R0 {\textgreater} 1, there exists an unique endemic equilibrium which is asymptotically stable on the positive orthant.},

	abstract = {We study the stability properties of a susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS) diffusion model, so-called the n-intertwined Markov model, over arbitrary directed network topologies. As in the majority of the work on infection spread dynamics, this model exhibits a threshold phenomenon. When the curing rates in the network are high, the disease-free equilibrium is the unique equilibrium over the network. Otherwise, an endemic equilibrium state emerges, where some infection remains within the network. Using notions from positive systems theory, we provide novel proofs for the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points in both cases over strongly connected networks based on the value of the basic reproduction number, a fundamental quantity in the study of epidemics. When the network topology is weakly connected, we provide conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and global asymptotic stability of an endemic state, and study the stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Finally, we demonstrate that the n-intertwined Markov model can be viewed as a best-response dynamical system of a concave game among the nodes. This characterization allows us to cast new infection spread dynamics; additionally, we provide a sufficient condition for global convergence to the disease-free equilibrium, which can be checked in a distributed fashion.},
